this submarine is more a living thing than a submarine, so reading his workshop description is essential to use and enjoy it since there are all the new
and strange features that I have implemented and they are not in the base game such as

    * **It needs food**
    * **It's not recomended leaving him alone**
    * **It has a way to distribute itÂ´s energy**
    * **~~low specs PC wont be able to run this shit~~**
    * **It speaks**
    * **It can't be sneaky, you will always figth monsters, but it doesnt matter, you need food**
    * **you can swich on/off or limit almost everything in this sub to economice enegy**
